# TranslationMultiplier
A very simple tool to multiply translations for Stellaris

This tool searches for all localization files as defined here: [https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Localisation_modding] within a directory hierarchy (including sub directories). For each file found, it creates a copy for each given language (command line arguments). If no language was specified it uses all defined default languages from paradox (currently: braz_por, english, french, german, polish, russian and spanish)
